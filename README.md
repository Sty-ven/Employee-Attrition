# PROJECT 1: Predicting Employee Attriton
The project is to help a company which is trying to control attrition. The data used for this project is obtained from the https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset. Following attributes are available for every employee.

*Education
*EnvironmentSatisfaction
*JobInvolvement
*JobSatisfaction
*PerformanceRating
*RelationshipSatisfaction
*WorkLifeBalance

Therefore I am going to answer the following questions:
1. What is the effect of Income on attrition?
2. Which set of people are most likey to quit their job?
3. What is the impact of Age on Employee Attrition?
